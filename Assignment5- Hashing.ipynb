    "Three sorting algorithms were tested for their time complexity in sorting lists of varying sizes of string elements. Each string element in the list was randomly populated with 50 alphabetic lower case characters. The number of elements within the list was varied. Five lists containing 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 strings were sorted via BubbleSort, MergeSort, and QuickSort. The times (given in milliseconds) required to perform the sort are collected and displayed in Table 1. By far, the most inefficient sorting algorithm demonstrated here is the bubble sort whose complexity is shown graphically (figure 1) to grow at n\\*n or O(n^2) rate. This makes sense for bubble sort as it compares n elements amongst n elements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the other two methodologies utilize a divide and conquer strategy. The list of strings when using QuickSort are divided into two arrays (greater and less) which contain values which are greater or less than a pivot value. In MergeSort a similar strategy is achieved by dividing the list into two arrays (left and right) which are left and right respectivly from the center element of the list. In both of these arrays recursion is used as the QuickSort and MergeSort functions are called on the subarrays. The result of this divide and conquer strategy is a complexity of n*logn or O(n*logn) in big O notation. A direct comparision of the times required for sorting the lists with these two methodologies are shown in Figure 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "In rare instances QuickSort may also dramatically underperform as the pivot element is always selected as the first item of the array (or subarray). If an array contained a list which was sorted largest to smallest already, this method could also have very high complexity as you would not divide the list recursively for an array of n size (this would also be n\\*n complexity O(n^2)). It is interesting the QuickSort seems to perform slightly better than MergeSort, but both are quite efficient. Because of the splitting methodology employed by the MergeSort, there lacks a risk of any deviation from the O(n*logn) complexity. The begining array and subarrays are always split in half size-wise. It's therefore recommended that the MergeSort method be used as the time complexity will always be constant. "
